      My name is Céline Viévard and I'm a first year BBA student at ESSEC Business School in Cergy. Don't worry, I haven't always lived in a small city like this, so I have much more to share... 🗺 To keep things short and interesting, I'll describe myself in a few emojis: 🛩🧙📸🎷. Now, it's your job to interpret them!

      <h2><b>My life 🖋</b></h2>
      <p>
        As I've mentionned before, my life hasn't only been in Cergy this whole time - <em>thank god</em>. I've had the luck to have grown up in the South of France, Santa Barbara in the United States, Puerto Vallarta in Mexico, Paris (in France - not Texas) and soon in Singapore! I am so thankful for these opportunities and have done the most with it by learning how to speak French, English, Spanish and (a very small bit) of Chinese! I've also taught these languages to younger kids in the last 5 years.

      <h2><b>Sports 🏄</b></h2>
      <p> 
        One of my hobbies: SPORTS! Ever since I'm a little girl, I've been doing it. Name the sport - I did it. Baseball, basketball, volleyball, swimming, horse riding... Been there, done that. But the two that stand out the most: gymnastics and running. Gymnastics because I did competition-level for nearly 6 years. I loved working and improving with my team, I loved competing, I loved performing anf I loved the adrenaline. Now, I run. I would run on a weekly basis. During confinement, it was everyday! Not going to lie, I haven't been on a run for a good month now though ahha but soon I will.

      <h2><b>Traveling & Photography 🧳</b></h2>
      <p>
        Since I've had the luck to travel - I've always done the most to preserve all my memories from it. And that is through photography. Here are a few pics from my favorite trips:

      <h2><b>Music 🎵</b></h2>
      <p>
        Due to Covid and my student budget, I haven't exactly been travelling as much, so I found new interests and one amongst them is music! I don't play any instruments but I love spending <em>hours</em> on Spotify looking for new music. My favorite genre right now is house techno. I'll link below a few playlists of mine if ever you want to get groovy. There are all kinds: house, reggaetton, chill, party...

      I also happen to have a few cute pics of my friends - some whom I've had the opportunity to travel with, some not yet! You'll find a few below, some of them are my high school friends and the others are those I met at ESSEC this year.
